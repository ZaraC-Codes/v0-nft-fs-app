- Revolutionary cross-collection bundling requires intuitive UX
- Complex treasury management needs community-friendly interfaces  
- Zero-collateral rentals need clear delegation explanations
- Social features require familiar but branded interaction patterns
- Future metaverse integration needs 3D-ready design language
