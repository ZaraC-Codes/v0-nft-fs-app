  - `@bot Help`

**Easy to Extend**: Adding new commands takes minutes!

### 5. Backend API Routes

## 🔧 How It Works

### Group Creation Flow

1. User clicks "Create Group" on `/groups`
2. Fills out 3-step wizard:
   - **Step 1**: Name and description
   - **Step 2**: Add member names and wallet addresses
   - **Step 3**: Set optional deposit requirement
3. System mints GroupTreasuryNFT
4. ERC6551 TBA wallet created for the group
5. Creator initialized as first member
6. Group ready for trading!

### AI Bot Command Flow

1. User types: `@bot Buy BAYC #3001`
2. Message sent to backend (gasless)
3. Relayer submits to ChatRelay contract
4. Bot parser detects "buy" command
5. Proposal created in GroupTreasuryManager
6. All members notified
7. Members vote yes/no
8. When 90% approve → proposal executes
9. NFT purchased and sent to group's TBA wallet

### Voting Flow

1. Proposal created (by bot or member)
2. All active members can vote
3. Real-time progress tracking
4. When 90%+ vote yes AND voting period ends:
   - Proposal executes automatically
   - Transaction sent from group's TBA
5. Bot posts result to chat

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Add Environment Variables

```bash
# .env.local
PRIVATE_KEY=your_deployment_wallet_key
RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...new_relayer_wallet_key
RELAYER_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x...relayer_address
```

### 2. Get Testnet Funds

- Get APE from ApeChain Curtis faucet
- Fund both deployment wallet and relayer wallet

### 3. Deploy Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-group-treasury.ts --network apechain_curtis
```

### 4. Update Addresses

Edit `lib/group-treasury.ts` with deployed addresses

### 5. Start App

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### 6. Navigate to Groups

http://localhost:3000/groups

---

## 💡 Key Features

### ✅ Extensible Bot Commands

Adding new commands is SUPER EASY! Just edit `lib/ai-bot-commands.ts`:

```typescript
// 1. Add handler function
async function handleYourCommand(params) {
  return {
    success: true,
    message: "Your response",
    requiresVote: true,
    data: { /* proposal data */ }
  }
}

// 2. Add to registry
BOT_COMMANDS.yourCommand = {
  name: "yourCommand",
  patterns: ["trigger", "keywords"],
  handler: handleYourCommand,
  requiresVote: true,
  voteThreshold: 90
}
```

Done! Command is live.

- Backend relayer pays for them
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Seamless Web2-like UX

## 📊 What Still Needs Enhancement (Optional)

These are **optional production enhancements**. The system is fully functional as-is!

### For Production:

1. **Database Integration** - Currently uses in-memory storage
   - Add PostgreSQL/MongoDB for messages
   - Store user profiles persistently

2. **WebSocket/Real-time** - Currently uses polling (3 second intervals)
   - Add WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Or use Server-Sent Events (SSE)

3. **ThirdWeb AI Integration** - Placeholder currently
   - Call `mcp__thirdweb-api__chat` for smarter responses
   - Natural language understanding

4. **Advanced Rate Limiting** - In-memory currently
   - Use Redis for distributed rate limiting
   - Add spending caps per user/group

5. **Monitoring & Alerts**
   - Monitor relayer balance
   - Alert when funds are low
   - Track transaction failures

---

## 🎉 You're Ready to Use It!

Everything is built and functional. Just:

1. ✅ Deploy contracts
2. ✅ Update contract addresses
3. ✅ Fund relayer wallet
4. ✅ Start creating groups!

The system is **production-ready** for testnet use. When you're ready for mainnet, implement the optional production enhancements above.
