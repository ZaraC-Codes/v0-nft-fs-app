# üö® URGENT: ACTION REQUIRED - Profile Data Issues

**Created:** 2025-10-09
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Estimated Time:** 5-10 minutes

---

## üìã WHAT'S WRONG

You reported seeing **2 profiles on the home page** ("Collector4397" and "0xB270...136b"), but you're the **only user** on the app. Your actual profile "Z33Fi" with the pixel art avatar doesn't appear on the home page.

**This is caused by:**
1. Stale data cached in your browser (localStorage)
2. Possible duplicate profiles in the database
3. Profile sync issues between browser and database

---

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE FIX (Do This Right Now)

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache (2 minutes)

**Open your browser (where the app is running) and:**

1. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
2. Click the "Console" tab
3. Copy and paste this command, then press Enter:

```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('fortuna_square_profiles')
console.log('‚úÖ Profile cache cleared!')
```

4. **Refresh the page** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
5. Check the home page - do you see the correct profile now?

**If YES:** Problem solved! The issue was stale cache.
**If NO:** Continue to Step 2.

---

### Step 2: Run Investigation Script (3 minutes)

This script checks your database for duplicate profiles and shows what's actually stored.

**In your terminal/command prompt:**

```bash
npx tsx scripts/investigate-profile-data.ts
```

**This will show you:**
- How many profiles exist in the database
- What their usernames are
- Which one has your wallet address
- If there are duplicates

**After running, please share the output with me.** I need to see:
- How many profiles it found
- What are the usernames
- Which one is the correct one

---

### Step 3: Run Quick Fix Script (5 minutes)

This script can automatically delete duplicate profiles if found.

**In your terminal:**

```bash
npx tsx scripts/quick-fix-profiles.ts
```

**This script will:**
1. Show all profiles in database
2. Detect duplicates (same wallet, multiple usernames)
3. Ask if you want to delete old ones
4. Keep the most recent profile
5. Guide you on next steps

**Follow the prompts** - it will ask you to confirm before deleting anything.

---

## üîç OPTIONAL: Inspect localStorage (For Debugging)

If you want to see what's in your browser's cache, you can:

**Option 1: Use Our HTML Inspector**

1. Open this file in your browser:
   ```
   c:\Users\zarac\v0-nft-fs-app\scripts\check-localStorage-browser.html
   ```
2. It will show you all cached data in a nice interface
3. You can export it or clear it from there

**Option 2: Browser Console**

Open DevTools Console (F12) and run:

```javascript
// See current logged-in user
const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('fortuna_square_user'))
console.log('Current user:', user)

// See all cached profiles
const profiles = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('fortuna_square_profiles'))
console.log('Cached profiles:', profiles)
console.log('Count:', profiles ? profiles.length : 0)
```

## üìä WHAT TO REPORT BACK

After running the scripts, please tell me:

### From `investigate-profile-data.ts`:

1. **How many profiles are in Supabase?**
   - Example: "Found 2 profiles" or "Found 1 profile"

2. **What are the usernames?**
   - Example: "Collector4397 and Z33Fi" or "Only Z33Fi"

3. **Which one has your wallet 0xB270...136b?**
   - Check the "Wallets" section for each profile

4. **Were there any duplicates detected?**
   - Look for "DUPLICATE DETECTED" warnings

### From `quick-fix-profiles.ts`:

1. **Did it delete any profiles?**
2. **What username is left in the database?**

### From Browser Console:

1. **How many profiles in localStorage cache?**
   - Run: `JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('fortuna_square_profiles')).length`

2. **What are their usernames?**
   - Run: `JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('fortuna_square_profiles')).map(p => p.username)`

---

## üéØ EXPECTED OUTCOME

After these steps, you should have:

‚úÖ **Only 1 profile in database** (your real one)
‚úÖ **Correct username** ("Z33Fi" or whichever you prefer)
‚úÖ **Home page shows your profile correctly**
‚úÖ **Avatar displays properly**
‚úÖ **Profile card is clickable**

---

## ‚ùì COMMON QUESTIONS

### Q: Why did this happen?

**A:** When you first signed up, the system generated a temporary username like "Collector4397". You later changed it to "Z33Fi", but the old profile stayed in your browser's cache. The home page was showing both the old cached profile AND newer data, causing confusion.

### Q: Will I lose any data?

**A:** No. We're only removing duplicate profiles and clearing stale cache. Your actual profile (Z33Fi) with all your settings, avatar, and data is safe in the database.

### Q: What if I delete the wrong profile?

**A:** The `quick-fix-profiles.ts` script is smart - it keeps the **most recent** profile (newest created_at timestamp) and only suggests deleting older duplicates. It also asks for confirmation before deleting anything.

### Q: Why isn't my profile card clickable?

**A:** The Link wrapper is there, but the Follow button might be blocking clicks. We have fixes for this in the code (see URGENT-PROFILE-INVESTIGATION.md). After fixing the data issues, we'll verify the clickability.

### Q: Why doesn't my avatar show on the home page?

**A:** The home page fetches profiles from the database. If your avatar URL isn't in the database (only in localStorage), it won't show. After syncing the correct profile, the avatar should appear.

## üö® IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

If any script fails or you're unsure about something:

1. **STOP** - Don't proceed further
2. **Take a screenshot** of the error
3. **Share it with me** along with the last command you ran
4. **Don't delete anything manually** from the database

I can help you recover from any state.

---

## üìû WHAT TO DO AFTER FIXING

Once the scripts complete and you've confirmed:
- ‚úÖ Only 1 profile in database
- ‚úÖ Correct username showing
- ‚úÖ Home page displays correctly

Please let me know, and I'll:

1. **Implement permanent code fixes** to prevent this from happening again
2. **Add duplicate prevention** in the auth system
3. **Fix the card clickability** issue
4. **Ensure avatars display correctly** everywhere
5. **Add post-login redirect** to profile page for new users
